    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the Upper Mattaponi Tribe agreed to support the establishment of the Indigenous Conservation Council (ICC), a 501(c)3 organization co-created by the seven federally recognized tribes to build the capacity of Tribal Nations to rematriate and care for their lands in a manner that reinforces sovereignty and self-determination; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>

    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>

    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
